A tool for daily creative disruption. Receive unexpected prompts, surrender to strangeness, witness your creative patterns emerge over time.

## Why?

Routine thinking creates invisible walls. `estrange` disrupts these patterns through daily creative disruption - one unexpected prompt at a time. It's not about producing brilliant ideas (though you might). It's about keeping your mind flexible and surprising.

## Get Started

**Web App:** [kalley.github.io/estrange](https://kalley.github.io/estrange) - Start immediately, no installation required
**CLI Tool:** Perfect for terminal enthusiasts and automation - see [CLI documentation](./packages/cli/README.md)

## How It Works

`estrange` embraces the rhythm of **once daily** - multiple interactions return the same prompt until tomorrow.

### The Daily Ritual
1. üåÄ Receive today's creative disruption
2. ‚ú® Encounter an unexpected prompt
3. üìù Process the strangeness in your own way
4. üíæ Store your creative response
5. üîç Reflect on patterns over time

## Example Disruptions

Here are some prompts `estrange` might serve you:

**"A doorknob that remembers every hand that's touched it"**
*What stories would it tell? How would this change architecture? Privacy? Security?*

**"Gravity works sideways on Tuesdays"**
*How would cities adapt? What would Tuesday fashion look like? Emergency protocols?*

**"The sound purple makes when it's thinking"**
*What does color consciousness feel like? How would you compose this? Paint it? Live it?*

**"Libraries where books read themselves to you, but only whisper the boring parts"**
*What gets whispered? What stays silent? How do you find the exciting parts?*

## Your Creative Journey

After weeks or months of disruptions, analyze your creative DNA:
- **What creative territories do I gravitate toward?**
- **Which prompts sparked my most expansive thinking?**
- **How has my creative process evolved?**
- **What patterns am I stuck in? How can I break them?**
- **What types of strangeness do I resist? Why might that be?**

## Data Autonomy

Your creative journey belongs to you:
- **Local-first:** Web app uses browser storage, CLI uses SQLite
- **Portable:** Export and move your data between platforms
- **Private:** Nothing leaves your device unless you choose
- **Yours:** Own your creative process completely

## Philosophy

`estrange` embraces:
- **Surrender over control:** Let strangeness work through you
- **Process over product:** The thinking matters more than the output
- **Consistency over intensity:** Small daily disruptions compound
- **Privacy over sharing:** Your creative space, your rules
- **Questions over answers:** Good prompts generate more questions
- **Estrangement over familiarity:** Break patterns, see with fresh eyes
- **Autonomy over convenience:** You own your creative journey completely
